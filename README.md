# KDE Material You Colors (beta)
### Automatic Material You Colors Generator from your wallpaper for the Plasma Desktop

This is a Python program that uses the [C# implementation](https://github.com/albi005/MaterialColorUtilities) of Google's [Material Color Utilities](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities) by @albi005, to extract a color from an image and then generate a Material Design 3 color scheme. Which is used to generate both Light and Dark Color Themes for KDE.

<span style="color:#ff6568"> **You may need to update to latest Plasma 5.24 due to a BUG related to [this one](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=445058) that blocks this program from getting the current wallpaper.** </span>


# Running from terminal
- Run `kde-material-you-colors` from terminal, if you use the default wallpaper plugin on your main screen (0) this should change your Desktop colors right after.


**NOTE:** your wallpaper will be reset to Image Wallpaper Plugin

- If you use a multimonitor setup and want your wallpaper from other screen or use a different wallpaper plugin find your desired configuration by experimenting with the following:

### Options
`--monitor, -m [NUMBER]`&emsp; Monitor to get wallpaper (default is 0) but second one is 6 in my case, play with this to find yours

`--plugin -p [ID]`&emsp; Wallpaper plugin id (default is org.kde.image) you can find them in: /usr/share/plasma/wallpapers/ or /.local/share/plasma/wallpapers

`--file -f [ABSOLUTE_PATH]`&emsp; Text file that contains wallpaper absolute path (Takes precedence over the above options)

`--ncolor -n [NUMBER]`&emsp; Alternative color mode (default is 0), some images return more than one color, this will use either the matched or last one

`--light -l`&emsp; Enable Light mode (default is Dark)

`--dark -d`&emsp; Enable Dark mode (ignores user config)

`--autostart -a`&emsp; Enable (copies) the startup script to automatically start with KDE

`--copyconfig -c`&emsp; Copies the default config to ~/.config/kde-material-you-colors/config.conf

`--iconslight [ICONS-NAME]`&emsp; Icons for Dark scheme

`--iconsdark [ICONS-NAME]`&emsp; Icons for Light scheme

`--pywallight -wall`&emsp; Use pywal Light scheme

`--pywaldark -wald`&emsp; Use pywal Dark scheme

`--lbmultiplier [NUMBER], -lbm [NUMBER]`&emsp; The amount of color for backgrounds in Light mode (value from 0 to 4.0, default is 1)

`--dbmultiplier [NUMBER], -dbm [NUMBER]`&emsp; The amount of color for backgrounds in Dark mode (value from 0 to 4.0, default is 1)

# Startup script:

1. Copy the default configuration to ~/.config/kde-material-you-colors/config.conf:

`kde-material-you-colors -c` 

2. Enable script to automatically start with Plasma:

`kde-material-you-colors -a` 

3. Reboot or logout/login to see the changes,

**NOTE:** your wallpaper will be reset to Image Wallpaper Plugin

# Changing Current Wallpaper plugin

<span style="color:#ff6568"> **Use the configuration file !!** </span>

Using Plasma Wallpaper Settings may Crash Plasmashell and will set again the plugin from Configuration file

# Bugs
- As throwaway6560192 pointed out, the `evaluateScript` DBus call doesn't return any output, to get the current wallpaper, I'm using `print()`, but the journal gets spammed by plasmashell with the wallpaper path. If you know a better way of doing this please tell me.
- To update color with `plasma-apply-colorscheme`, the file containing the new color scheme must have a different name than the current one, to workaround this it creates two scheme files with different names, then applies one after the other. As a result you end up with duplicated color schemes and maybe some lag while updating schemes.
- If you encounter a problem (sure there will be) don't hesitate to open an issue.
- This is not a bug but I'm a noob developer, so expect spaggeti code, PRs to improve it are very wellcomed.
